# SDKs

This directory contains the official SDKs for LLMList.

- `js/`: JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (published as `llm-list`)
- `python/`: Python SDK (published as `llm-list`)
- `go/`: Go SDK (published as `github.com/yourusername/llm-list/sdks/go`)

## Development

The `llm_registry.json` is automatically synced to `sdks/js/` during the build process to ensure the JS SDK has the latest data bundled.
